    <h1>picked:drink in the store without paying</h1>
    
    <p>you decided to drink in the store since you either had no money<br>
      and you were thirsty, but as soon as you opened the lid and ready<br>
      to take a nice cold drink, you were shotgunned to the face since<br>
      the home owner hates people without paying.
      
    <p><strong>you died, get money first dum</strong></p>
