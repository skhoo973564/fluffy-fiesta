    <h1>picked: have a dollar</h1>
    
    <p>you decided to give the owner a shiny $1 dollar coin for<br>
      a water bottle and not the figure since you thought he<br>
      would say no and shotgun you to the face since he<br>
      has a shotgun in his counter. Instead he said that was<br>
      supposed to be $2 dollars, but you don't have any more<br>
      money so he shotgunned you to the face and you ended up<br>
      dying.</p>
